Final Project: Create and Application that fulfills the requirements below. Utilize what you have learned from this course to complete this project. You can team-up with up to 3 developers and collaborate. Use the Software Development Life Cycle to guide you through this project. You must share your code with each other, so you all have a copy. You may even define roles for each out, but you should all collaborate as a team. Include comments where needed. Test your code. You will be doing a presentation to the class and guests. They will ask questions on your approach to this product. This application is a proof of concept for a retail application, so you can provide currency values for the product. Good Luck to you all.

You are a company who manufactures radio controlled cars. They come in different shapes and sizes, but are divided into two categories: Street Cars and Off-Road Cars. Both types come with wheels and tires, but only off-road cars get wide wheels and tires. Both types also come with shocks, body frame, body shell and a motor. Included in the box is a remote control, a rechargeable battery and charger.

The body shells of these radio controlled cars are made of different shapes while fitting on one frame design. For Street Cars, there are 3 body shell types: Sport, SUV and classic. For Off-Road Cars there are 3 body shell types: ATV, Dune Buggy & Crawlers. There are also optional shells that can be purchased for an additional fee: Military, and Trucks. There are optional wheels and tires that can be purchased for an additional fee as well. You will be able to pick your own styles for those. There is an optional battery that can also be purchased as well. Each retail package will have its own UPC symbol and model number.

Your job is to create an inventory style application that allows you to add, remove, and print the information from your inventory. These are called CRUD actions and are common in computer applications. It is the process of creating reading and updating information.
